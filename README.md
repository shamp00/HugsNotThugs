HugsNotThugsApp
================

HugsNotThugs was joint winner of the PeaceHackLDN 2015 hackathon.

HugsNotThugs aims to provide creative activites for vulnerable teenagers in crime-ridden areas of London in order to dissuade them from gng culture and violent extremism.

This app is a platform to help event organisers target specific locations. An organiser can create a new event and specify the radius in meters. Youth clubs, schools and teenagers will then be informed of the nearby events, filtered by interest if desired.
